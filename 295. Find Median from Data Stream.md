## 295. Find Median from Data Stream
```java
Median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value. So the median is the mean of the two middle value.

For example,
[2,3,4], the median is 3

[2,3], the median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5

Design a data structure that supports the following two operations:

void addNum(int num) - Add a integer number from the data stream to the data structure.
double findMedian() - Return the median of all elements so far.
 

Example:

addNum(1)
addNum(2)
findMedian() -> 1.5
addNum(3) 
findMedian() -> 2
 

Follow up:

If all integer numbers from the stream are between 0 and 100, how would you optimize it?
If 99% of all integer numbers from the stream are between 0 and 100, how would you optimize it
```

### Solution 1: two heaps
- add: O(lgn), add new num into left and right heaps and balance them to make sure (left.size-right.size()<=1)
- computer median O(1): find the median from middle

```java
class MedianFinder {
     PriorityQueue<Integer> left;
     PriorityQueue<Integer> right;
    /** initialize your data structure here. */
    public MedianFinder() {
        left = new PriorityQueue<>(new Comparator<Integer>() {
            @Override
            public int compare(Integer o1, Integer o2) {
                return o2.compareTo(o1);
            }
        }); //Max heap
        right = new PriorityQueue<>(); //Min heap
    }
    
    public void addNum(int num) {
        //put all small parts to left
        if(left.isEmpty() || num <= left.peek()){
            left.add(num);
        }else {
            right.add(num);
        }
        
        //balance the left and right heaps
        if(left.size()<right.size()){
            left.add(right.poll());
            //right.pop();
        }else if(left.size()-right.size()>=2){
            right.add(left.poll());
            //left.pop();
        }
        
    }
    
    public double findMedian() {
        int l = left.size();
        int r = right.size();
        if(l==r){
            return (double)((left.peek()+right.peek())/2.0);
        }else{
            return (double)(left.peek());
        }
    }
}

/**
 * Your MedianFinder object will be instantiated and called as such:

 * obj.addNum(num);
 * double param_2 = obj.findMedian();
