## 221. Maximal Square
```java
Given a 2D binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest square containing only 1's and return its area.

Example:

Input: 

1 0 1 0 0
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 0

Output: 4

```

### Explanation
- brute force method is to check every start point with different size(like, size 1 square, 2*2, 3*3) (O(m*n)*min(m, n))
- then check the square are all 1 O(m*n)
- But there are some duplicate compuataion when we check size 3, since we already check size 2 square
