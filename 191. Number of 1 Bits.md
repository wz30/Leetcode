## 191. Number of 1 Bits

### Solution 1
- n & (1<<i) to check each bit and i is [0, 31]
```java
public class Solution {
    // you need to treat n as an unsigned value
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int res = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i<32; i++){
            if( (n & (1<<i))!=0) res++;
        }  
        return res;
    }
}
```
