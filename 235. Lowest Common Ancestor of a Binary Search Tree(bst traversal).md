# 235  Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree
Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

Given binary search tree:  root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5]


 

Example 1:

Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
Output: 6
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
Example 2:

Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
 

Note:

All of the nodes' values will be unique.
p and q are different and both values will exist in the BST.

## Explanation
Using bst traveral

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        //using the feature of bst, left < root < right , question is what if the are equal(bst is not alowed)
        //But we can use count for duplicate value
        //Here if p and q samller than root, then keep 
        //if min(p, q) > root , they are in right subtree
        //else if(max(p,q) < root) they are in left subtree
        //else return res
        //return dfs(root, p,q);
        
        //while loop
        
        while(root!=null){
            if(Math.min(p.val, q.val) > root.val){
                root = root.right;
            }

            else if(Math.max(p.val, q.val) < root.val){
                root = root.left;
            }

            else{
                 root =  root;
                break;
            }

        }
        return root;
    }
    //recursive way
    TreeNode dfs(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q){
        //
        if(root==null) return null;
        
        if(Math.min(p.val, q.val) > root.val){
            return dfs(root.right, p, q);
        }
        
        else if(Math.max(p.val, q.val) < root.val){
            return dfs(root.left, p,q);
        }
        
        else return root;
        
    }
}
