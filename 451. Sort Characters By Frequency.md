## 451. Sort Characters By Frequency
Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.

Example 1:

Input:
"tree"

Output:
"eert"

Explanation:
'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
Example 2:

Input:
"cccaaa"

Output:
"cccaaa"

Explanation:
Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
Example 3:

Input:
"Aabb"

Output:
"bbAa"

Explanation:
"bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.

### Explanation
- using hp or array since the frequency are number

### Solution:
- hashmap for frequency and character
- put them into priorityqueue
```java
class Solution {
    public String frequencySort(String s) {
        int[] str = new int[130];
        for(char a : s.toCharArray()){
            str[a]++;
        }
        // frequency(map into array) : character1, character2
        ArrayList[] list = new ArrayList[s.length()+1];
        
        for(int i=0; i< str.length; i++){
            int temp = str[i];
            if(temp!=0){
                if(list[temp]==null){
                    list[temp] = new ArrayList<Character>();
                }
                list[temp].add((char) i);
            }
        }
        StringBuilder b = new StringBuilder();
        for(int i = s.length(); i>=0; i--){
            if(list[i]!=null){
                ArrayList<Character> temp = list[i];
                for(Character c : temp){
                    for(int k = i; k>=1; k--)
                        b.append(c);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return b.toString();
    }
}
```
