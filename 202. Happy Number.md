## Problem
```java
Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Example: 

Input: 19
Output: true
Explanation: 
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1
```

## Solution
- the key: eithor get 1 or in a cycle(detected by hashset)
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isHappy(int n) {
        
        //get 1 or have a cycle
        int temp = n;
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet();
        
        while(true){
            n = temp;
            temp = 0;
            set.add(n);
            while(n!=0){
                int s = n%10; //s: 9
                n = n/10;
                temp = s*s + temp;
            }
            if(temp==1) return true;
            if(set.contains(temp)) break;
                
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

## Solution 2
- using two pointer slow and fast and help funtion getNext()
- always has the graph or cycle in mind 
```java
class Solution {
    //19 
    int getNext(int num){
        int sum = 0;
        while(num>0){
            int k = num%10;
            num = num/10;
            sum = sum+k*k;
        }
        return sum;
    }
    public boolean isHappy(int n) {
        //27  4+ 49 = 53 25 9 34 , 9 16 25, 4 25->29 4 + 81-> 85 64 25 ->  
        //using two pointer to check
        int slow = n;
        int fast = getNext(n);
        //will break if fast==1(fast will reach first) or slow==fast
        while(fast!=1 && slow!=fast){
            //slow get next
            slow = getNext(slow);
            //fast get next, get next
            fast = getNext(getNext(fast));
        }
        
        return fast==1;
    }
}
```
