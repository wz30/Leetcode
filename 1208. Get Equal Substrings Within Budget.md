## Problem
```java
You are given two strings s and t of the same length. You want to change s to t. Changing the i-th character of s to i-th character of t costs |s[i] - t[i]| that is, the absolute difference between the ASCII values of the characters.

You are also given an integer maxCost.

Return the maximum length of a substring of s that can be changed to be the same as the corresponding substring of twith a cost less than or equal to maxCost.

If there is no substring from s that can be changed to its corresponding substring from t, return 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcd", t = "bcdf", maxCost = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: "abc" of s can change to "bcd". That costs 3, so the maximum length is 3.
Example 2:

Input: s = "abcd", t = "cdef", maxCost = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: Each character in s costs 2 to change to charactor in t, so the maximum length is 1.
Example 3:

Input: s = "abcd", t = "acde", maxCost = 0
Output: 1
Explanation: You can't make any change, so the maximum length is 1.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length, t.length <= 10^5
0 <= maxCost <= 10^6
s and t only contain lower case English letters.
```

## Solution 1
- Problem explanation: find largest lenght of contagious subarray <= maxCOst
- sliding windown O(n) or binary search
- boundary is annoying
```java
class Solution {
    public int equalSubstring(String s, String t, int maxCost) {
        int res = 0;
        int len = s.length();
        int[] arr = new int[len];
        for(int i = 0; i<s.length(); i++){
            if(s.charAt(i)==t.charAt(i)){
                res++;
            }
            arr[i] = Math.abs(s.charAt(i)-t.charAt(i));
            //System.out.println(arr[i]);
        }
        if(maxCost==0) return res;
        //sliding window
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        int max = 0;
        int sum = 0;
        while(i<len && j <len){
            
            if(sum <= maxCost){
                
                sum+=arr[j];
                //boundary case: when 3 4 7 0 and cost is 14
                if(sum >= maxCost){
                    if(j==len-1 && sum==maxCost){
                        max= Math.max((j-i)+1, max);
                    }else{
                        max= Math.max((j-i), max);    
                    }  
                }else{
                    max = Math.max((j-i)+1, max); 
                }
                j++;
                
                
            }else{
                sum-=arr[i];
                i++;
                
            }
            
        }
        
        return max;
    }
}
```

### Solution 2
- binary search
