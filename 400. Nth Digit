Find the nth digit of the infinite integer sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, ...

Note:
n is positive and will fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer (n < 231).

Example 1:

Input:
3

Output:
3
Example 2:

Input:
11

Output:
0

Explanation:
The 11th digit of the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, ... is a 0, which is part of the number 10.

//Solution: accumalate the result and find the conenction, use one or two examples to simulate the whole process
class Solution {
    public int findNthDigit(int n) {
        //1-9 : 9
        //10 - 99 : 90
        //100 - 999 : 900
        long i = (long) n;
        long tag = 9;
        long count = 1;
        long start = 1;
        //99 as example
        while(i > tag*count)
        {
            i = i-(tag*count);// 90 
            tag = tag*10;//90
            count ++; //2
            start *= 10;//10
        }
        start  = start + (i-1)/count;//n-9 before so + 1 to equal start
        String s = Long.toString(start);
        return s.charAt((int)((i-1)%count))-'0';
        
    }
}
