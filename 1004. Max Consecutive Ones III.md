## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int longestOnes(int[] A, int K) {
        int i=0, j = 0;
        int max  = 0;
        for(j = 0; j<A.length; j++){
            if(A[j]==0){
                K--;
            }
            if(K<0){
                if(A[i]==0) K++;
                i++;
            }
        }
        return j-i;
    }
}
```

## More explanations
```
For everyone who is confused about how this method works like I used to be, here is my explanation of the solution:

Take A = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], K = 3 for example.
We know the answer is 10 with subarray from A[2] to A[11].
Through the iteration of j, this subarray would be found while j = 11 and i = 2.
What happens then?
Well as we keep iterate j we will find out that j and i keep adding 1 in every iteration, which makes the distance between j and i the same(and is the currently best).
The distance between j and i would change again if there is a longer subarray exist.
Try appending more 1s in A you'll see.

In short:
We are looking for bigger window size, when we find one, we use this window to iterate till we find a larger one(if any).
