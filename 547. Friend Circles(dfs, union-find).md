## 547 Friend Circles
There are N students in a class. Some of them are friends, while some are not. Their friendship is transitive in nature. For example, if A is a direct friend of B, and B is a direct friend of C, then A is an indirect friend of C. And we defined a friend circle is a group of students who are direct or indirect friends.

Given a N*N matrix M representing the friend relationship between students in the class. If M[i][j] = 1, then the ith and jth students are direct friends with each other, otherwise not. And you have to output the total number of friend circles among all the students.

Example 1:
Input: 
[[1,1,0],
 [1,1,0],
 [0,0,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation:The 0th and 1st students are direct friends, so they are in a friend circle. 
The 2nd student himself is in a friend circle. So return 2.
Example 2:
Input: 
[[1,1,0],
 [1,1,1],
 [0,1,1]]
Output: 1
Explanation:The 0th and 1st students are direct friends, the 1st and 2nd students are direct friends, 
so the 0th and 2nd students are indirect friends. All of them are in the same friend circle, so return 1.
Note:
N is in range [1,200].
M[i][i] = 1 for all students.
If M[i][j] = 1, then M[j][i] = 1.

## Explanation
Find the connect components. This problem can definitely be solved by Union find, but not sure about dfs. 
In fact I did not solve this issue by dfs even though it is similiar to flood fill. But that model is not working here.

### Solution 1:
```java
class Solution {
    public int findCircleNum(int[][] M) {
        //flood fill model does not work
        int n = M.length;
        int[] parent = new int[n];
        for(int i = 0; i<parent.length; i++){
            parent[i] = i;
        }
        //union half
        for(int i = 0; i<n;i++){
            for(int j = 0; j<i; j++){
                if(M[i][j]==1){
                    union(i, j, parent);
                }
            }
        }
        //count the connect component
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        for(int ele : parent){
            //System.out.println(ele);
            set.add(ele);
        }
        return set.size();
    }
    void union(int i, int j, int[] parent){
        int pi = parent[i];
        int pj = parent[j];
        for(int m = 0; m<parent.length; m++){
            if(parent[m]==pi) parent[m] = pj;
        }
    }
}
```

### Solution 2:dfs
- checking start from first person and visited all his/her friends until all visited
- //one senetence solution: for each person, using dfs to check all direct friend, then mark them as visisted. 8/22/2020
```java
public class Solution {
    public int findCircleNum(int[][] M) {
        int count = 0;
        //the visited array
        int[] visited = new int[M.length];
        
        for(int i = 0; i < M.length; i++) {
            //if not visited
            if(visited[i] == 0) {
                dfs(M, visited, i);
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
    
    public void dfs(int[][] M, int[] visited, int i) {
        //for each i row
        for(int j = 0 ; j < M[0].length; j++) {
            //have circel and visited
            if(M[i][j] == 1 &&visited[j]==0) {
                visited[j] = 1;
                dfs(M, visited, j);
            }
        }
        
    }
}

//idea: chenge the two dismentions to one (use visited)
```

### Solution 3: dfs, slightly different from number of islands
```
class Solution {
    public int findCircleNum(int[][] M) {
        int res = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i<M.length; i++){
            for(int j = 0; j<M[0].length; j++){
                if(M[i][j]==1){
                    dfs(M, i, j);
                    res++;
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
    void dfs(int[][] M, int i, int j){
        if(M[i][j]==0) return;
        M[i][j] = 0;
        //search
        for(int k = 0; k<M[0].length; k++){
            if(M[j][k]==1)
                dfs(M, j, k);
        }
    }
}
```
