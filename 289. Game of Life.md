## Problem
- classic game

### Solution
- only using in-place array
- four states for cell:
  - state 0: dead->dead
  - state 1: live->live
  - state 2: live->dead
  - state 3: dead->live
  - then state%2
- algorithm:
```java
  for each cell(i, j):
  check 8 neighbors, only increase counter(couning live neightbors) when surrounding cells' state == 1 or 2 since thet are all from live
  after that: update state based on the counter (2, 3)

```
