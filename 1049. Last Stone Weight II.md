# 1049. Last Stone Weight II
We have a collection of rocks, each rock has a positive integer weight.

Each turn, we choose any two rocks and smash them together.  Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x <= y.  The result of this smash is:

    If x == y, both stones are totally destroyed;
    If x != y, the stone of weight x is totally destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y-x.

At the end, there is at most 1 stone left.  Return the smallest possible weight of this stone (the weight is 0 if there are no stones left.)

 

Example 1:

Input: [2,7,4,1,8,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
We can combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,7,1,8,1] then,
we can combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
we can combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
we can combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1] then that's the optimal value.

 

Note:

    1 <= stones.length <= 30
    1 <= stones[i] <= 100

## Explanation
- get smaller absolute value of the input array with adding + or -
- similiar to 494, target sum

### Solution 1: dp
- dp[i][j], pick first i element to rach up to j(sum. 1 means possible, 0 means impossible
- return the minimal j with 1
- [-sum, sum] +offset = [0, 2*sum]
```java
class Solution {
    public int lastStoneWeightII(int[] stones) {
        //find the minimal value
        int n = stones.length;
        int sum = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i<n;i++){
            sum+=stones[i];
        }
        int offset = sum;
        int[][] dp = new int[n+1][sum*2+1];
        dp[0][offset] = 1;
        //make dp with 0, 1 in it. 1 means possible, 0 mans: no such sum
        for(int i = 0; i<n; i++){
            for(int j = stones[i]; j<2*sum+1-stones[i]; j++){
                if(dp[i][j]==1){
                    dp[i+1][j-stones[i]] = dp[i][j];
                    dp[i+1][j+stones[i]] = dp[i][j];
                }
            }
        }
        for(int i = 0; i<2*sum+1; i++){
            if(dp[n][i+offset]==1)
                return i;
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```
