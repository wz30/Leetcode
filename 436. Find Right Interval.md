## 436. Find Right Interval
Given a set of intervals, for each of the interval i, check if there exists an interval j whose start point is bigger than or equal to the end point of the interval i, which can be called that j is on the "right" of i.

For any interval i, you need to store the minimum interval j's index, which means that the interval j has the minimum start point to build the "right" relationship for interval i. If the interval j doesn't exist, store -1 for the interval i. Finally, you need output the stored value of each interval as an array.

Note:

    You may assume the interval's end point is always bigger than its start point.
    You may assume none of these intervals have the same start point.

 

Example 1:

Input: [ [1,2] ]

Output: [-1]

Explanation: There is only one interval in the collection, so it outputs -1.

 

Example 2:

Input: [ [3,4], [2,3], [1,2] ]

Output: [-1, 0, 1]

Explanation: There is no satisfied "right" interval for [3,4].
For [2,3], the interval [3,4] has minimum-"right" start point;
For [1,2], the interval [2,3] has minimum-"right" start point.

 

Example 3:

Input: [ [1,4], [2,3], [3,4] ]

Output: [-1, 2, -1]

Explanation: There is no satisfied "right" interval for [1,4] and [3,4].
For [2,3], the interval [3,4] has minimum-"right" start point.

NOTE: input types have been changed on April 15, 2019. Please reset to default code definition to get new method signature.

### Explanation
- first: can not sort
- use map to indicate the original index of array
- chekc each endpoint and all the start points

### Solution 1: binary search
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] findRightInterval(int[][] intervals) {
        //can not sort -> so i give up
        //map to remeber the index of sorting index
        
        //<start, index
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        int[] arr = new int[intervals.length];
        int[] res = new int[intervals.length];
        for(int i = 0; i<intervals.length; i++){
            map.put(intervals[i][0], i);
            arr[i] = (intervals[i][0]);
        }
        //sort 
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        
        //end point is target and find the first ele in arr>= arr[i]>=endpoint
        for(int i = 0; i<intervals.length; i++){
            int temp = lower_bound(arr, intervals[i][1]);
            if(temp==arr.length) res[i] = -1;
            else res[i] = map.get(arr[temp]);
            
        }
        return res;
    }
    int lower_bound(int[] arr, int t){
        int l  =0;
        int r = arr.length;
        while(l < r){
            int m = (r-l)/2+l;
            if(arr[m]>=t) r = m;
            else l=m+1;
        }
        return l;
    }
}
```
