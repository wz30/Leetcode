## 1145. Binary Tree Coloring Game

### Solution 1
- complexixity time: O(n) # of nodes space: height of tree O(lg(n))
- count the sum of subtree
- convert problem into compare root, childreen of the node.
```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    int left, right;
    int val;
    public boolean btreeGameWinningMove(TreeNode root, int n, int x) {
        //After reading the discuss: the problem can be converted into:
        //if one player select the node, the entire subtree will belong to him
        //so we can easily check the root left child or right child of this node colored by player 1
        //the reson why we do not pick the sibilings that it is similiar to root.(root is even better)
        //so check count(left) count(right) count(root);
        //if any of those three gretaer than n/2
        val = x; left = 0; right = 0;
        count(root);
        return Math.max(Math.max(left, right), n-left-right-1)>(n/2);
    }
    int count(TreeNode node){
        if(node==null) return 0;
        int l = count(node.left);
        int r = count(node.right);
        if(node.val==val){
            left= l;
            right = r;
        }
        return l+r+1;
    }
}
```

### Follow up
```java
Fun Moment of Follow-up:
Alex and Lee are going to play this turned based game.
Alex draw the whole tree. root and n will be given.
Now Lee says he want to color the first node.

Return true if Lee can ensure his win, otherwise return false
Could you find the set all the nodes, that Lee can ensure he wins the game?
```
- save the node into a list when we check the # left, right, root.
