## 260. Single Number III

### Soution
- still use the idea of xor, but we have two single elemnt here
- So we need to seperate them
- Here is the point: how to tell different single element, reference
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        //get a and b seperately
        int diff = 0;
        for(int num : nums){
            diff ^= num;
        }
        diff = diff&(-diff);
        //diff is te righmost 1 in nums
        int[] res = new int[2];
        //10   11  
        //10 1001
        //System.out.println(2&5);
        for(int i = 0; i<nums.length; i++){
            if((diff&nums[i])==0) res[0]^=nums[i];
            else res[1]^= nums[i];
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

```java
//divide the number into two groups (3..)  (5..) then use xor
        //how: get the diff = 3^5 (why use xor: for distinct bit)
        // 011 ^ 101 = 110 -> 100 since we only need one bit
        int diff = 0;
        for(int i : nums){
            diff = diff^i;
        }
        int leftDiff = Integer.highestOneBit(diff); //100
        int[] res = new int[2];
        for(int k : nums){
            if((k&leftDiff)==0){//100 001 ; 000
                res[0] = res[0]^k;
            }else{
                res[1] = res[1]^k;
            }
        }
        return res;
```
