- categorized the problem  into the pattern
##  Pattern: Top ‘K’ Elements，前K个系列
- [x] Kth Largest Number in an Array (medium) (unorderes array)
- [x] 973. K Closest Points to Origin (same idea as last problem) (unordered arrray)
- [x] 658. Find K Closest Elements (Even the problem title looks similar to last two problems, the solutions are different sicne the array is sorted)(binary search + two pointers)
- [x] Top K frequent number (unordered array)
