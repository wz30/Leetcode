# probelm description
Given N, consider a convex N-sided polygon with vertices labelled A[0], A[i], ..., A[N-1] in clockwise order.

Suppose you triangulate the polygon into N-2 triangles.  For each triangle, the value of that triangle is the product of the labels of the vertices, and the total score of the triangulation is the sum of these values over all N-2 triangles in the triangulation.

Return the smallest possible total score that you can achieve with some triangulation of the polygon.

 

Example 1:

Input: [1,2,3]
Output: 6
Explanation: The polygon is already triangulated, and the score of the only triangle is 6.
Example 2:



Input: [3,7,4,5]
Output: 144
Explanation: There are two triangulations, with possible scores: 3*7*5 + 4*5*7 = 245, or 3*4*5 + 3*4*7 = 144.  The minimum score is 144.
Example 3:

Input: [1,3,1,4,1,5]
Output: 13
Explanation: The minimum score triangulation has score 1*1*3 + 1*1*4 + 1*1*5 + 1*1*1 = 13.
 

Note:

3 <= A.length <= 50
1 <= A[i] <= 100

# Explanation
- some keywords appear like optimal,  minimal and the problem can be divided into different subproblems lead this to dp problem
- The hard part is how to use dp, like 1d or 2d or 3d and what the meaning for dp[i]or dp[i][j]

Solution: memoization
```java
class Solution {
    public int minScoreTriangulation(int[] A) {
        //memo top down and bottom up
        //start from top to down
        //the point is rhe meaning of i, j
        //dp[i][j]: minimial score from Ai to Aj
        int[][] dp = new int[A.length][A.length];
        return helper(A, dp, 0, A.length-1);
    }
    int helper(int[] A, int[][] dp, int i, int j){
        if(dp[i][j] > 0) return dp[i][j];
        if(j-i==2){
            dp[i][j] = A[i]*A[i+1]*A[i+2];
            return dp[i][j];
        }
        if(j - i <2){
            return dp[i][j];//why here why 0
        }
        //i, j, k cur them into three parts
        int ans = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for(int k = i+1; k<j; k++){
            int left = helper(A, dp, i, k);
            int right = helper(A, dp, k, j);
            int middle = A[i]*A[k]*A[j];
            ans = Math.min(ans, left+right+middle);
        }
        dp[i][j] = ans;
        return dp[i][j];
    }
}
```
Solution 2: dp
