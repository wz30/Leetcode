## 275. H-Index II
Given an array of citations sorted in ascending order (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

Example:

Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
Output: 3 
Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
             received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively. 
             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.

Note:

If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

Follow up:

    This is a follow up problem to H-Index, where citations is now guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
    Could you solve it in logarithmic time complexity?


### Explanation
- It is hard to understand the problem
- The problem can be converted into find mimimal index which satisfies citations[index] >= length(citations) - index

### Solution 1: binary search
- time: O(lgn)
- spacce: O(1)
```java
class Solution {
    public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
        int n = citations.length;
        if(n==0) return 0;
        //find mimimal index which satisfies citations[index] >= length(citations) - index
        int temp = lower_bound(citations);
        return citations.length-temp;
    }
    int lower_bound(int[] list){
        int l = 0; int r = list.length;
        while(l < r){
            int m = (r-l)/2+l;
            if(list[m] >= list.length-m) r = m;//list is smaller that index
            else l = m+1;
        }
        return l;
    }
}
```
