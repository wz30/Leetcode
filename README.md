The problem in leetcode in java version

## leetcode number
- 36 Valid Sudoku [incomplete].
- 247 Strobogrammatic Number II [recursion(return each layer), time complexity?].
- 248 Strobogrammatic Number III [recursion(though dp may make faster), time?].
- 1186 Maximum Subarray Sum with One Deletion [O(n), dp(memory:O(1)), similar to maxium subarry]
- 53 Maximum Subarray [O(n), dp(memory:O(1))]
- 523 Continuous Subarray Sum [O(n^2), 1d dp(memory:O(n))] 
  - <strong>Solution 1</strong>: sum[i, j] = dp[j] - dp[i]+arr[i] or 
  - <strong>Solution 2</strong>: if a%k = c; b%k=c then(a-b)%k = 0(present it in hashmap)
## Always remember: no md, no accepted
- when you do not want write the md, that equals you solve nothing.
- However you are familiar with the problem, time will make you weak.
