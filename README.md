## leetcode number
- 36 Valid Sudoku [incomplete].
- 247 Strobogrammatic Number II [recursion(return each layer), time complexity?].
- 248 Strobogrammatic Number III [recursion(though dp may make faster), time?].
- 1186 Maximum Subarray Sum with One Deletion [O(n), dp(memory:O(1)), similar to maxium subarry]
- 53 Maximum Subarray [O(n), dp(memory:O(1))]
- 523 Continuous Subarray Sum [O(n^2), 1d dp(memory:O(n))] 
  - <strong>Solution 1</strong>: sum[i, j] = dp[j] - dp[i]+arr[i] or 
  - <strong>Solution 2</strong>: if a%k = c; b%k=c then(a-b)%k = 0(present it in hashmap)
- 1208 Get Equal Substrings Within Budget [understand problem and sliding window O(n)]

- 295 Find Median from Data Stream [two heaps(priority queue) O(lgn) to add number || balanced bst]
- 871 Minimum Number of Refueling Stops [heaps || ? o-1 kanpsack bags]
- 899 Orderly Queue [math and bubble sort || ? bfs tle]
- 1353 Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended [sort(by ending time) + greedy | bst+bs(?)]
- 1354 1354. Construct Target Array With Multiple Sums [module, reverse or backtrack + maxheap]
