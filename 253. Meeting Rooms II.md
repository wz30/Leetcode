## 253. Meeting Rooms II

### Solution 1
- two soted array
- check start[i] and end[j]
- we do not care which end for which, if we have end, then just as is, do not increase pointer. The idea here is not applied to the late leetcode problem - car pooling. Since it has capacity, so I need to know which end time mapped to whcih start time and decide if it is out of capacity.
- e.g. [[0,30], [1,5], [6,10], [7, 9], [8, 10]]
- i pointer to start array, and j point to end array. i means earliet start data and j mean earliest end date. If start[i]>=end[j] move to next j, do not increase the room number, otherwise, we need extra room for it.
```java
class Solution {
    public int minMeetingRooms(int[][] intervals) {
        int n = intervals.length;
        if(n==0) return 0;
        int[] start = new int[n];
        int[] end = new int[n];
        for(int i = 0; i<n; i++){
            start[i] = intervals[i][0];
            end[i] = intervals[i][1];
        }
        Arrays.sort(start);
        Arrays.sort(end);
        int j = 0;
        int res = 1;
        for(int i = 1; i<n; i++){
            if(start[i]>=end[j]){
                j++; continue;
            }else{
                res++;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
